# EDD Flat Rate Shipping
## Description
This plugin extends [Easy Digital Downloads](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/) so that you can apply a single flat-rate shipping charge to your shopping cart, whether the customer purchases one item or 1000 (or more!). 

This plugin is based on the [EDD Simple Shipping Plugin](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/downloads/simple-shipping/), which charges the customer a separate shipping charge for each item in the cart. The two shipping plugins are incompatible. You should activate either EDD Flat Rate Shipping OR EDD Simple Shipping, but not both.

Note: This plugin requires [Easy Digital Downloads](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/) 3.0 or greater. 

## Installation

Best Option: Install the plugin with WordPress by going to Plugins >> Add New >> and type this pluginâ€™s name. When you find it, click the "Install Now" button.

Alternately, if you want to install the plugin manually, follow these steps. 

1. Download the plugin to you local computer
2. Unpack the entire contents of this plugin zip file into a local folder on your computer
3. Upload the folder to the wp-content/plugins section of your website (use FTP or your website host's control panel)
4. Login to the WP admin area of your site, and navigate to Plugins section 
5. Click the "Activate" link for this plugin

## Main Settings
Once activated, the Main plugin settings for this plugin can be found in the "Downloads >> Settings >> Extensions" section of your admin area.

There are four options:
1. Set your Base Region to the country you operate out of
2. Set the "Domestic" Rate to the amount you want to charge for shipping to customers in your country
3. Set the "International" Rate to the amount you wan to charge for shipping to customers in other countries
4. Decide whether to disable tax on the shipping fees or not. 

Save changes, and you are done with the Main plugin settings. 

## Download Settings
There is also one setting for each Download item that you create.

When you create a Download for sale, check the Shipping Option box to charge shipping for this Download. 

If you leave this box unchecked, EDD will not charge shipping for that specific item. 

Please note that if there is at least ONE item in the shopping cart which requires shipping, the cart will add the flat-rate shipping fee to the cart.
